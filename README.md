The goal of abetareg is to start my project.

## Installation

You can install the development version of abetareg like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Jooooooonas/abetareg")
```

## Here is the current processing stage.

1.  Create a function (logLikVec.betareg) that calculates the individual
    log-likelihood contribution. (currently done)
2.  Create alogLik(). (currently done)
3.  Document the functions correctly and find a nice example. (currently
    done)
4.  Start writing vignettes and reports after stopping calling it
    AmazingJonas. Now it is package “abetareg”.
